# Revisiting Binary Local Image Description for Resource Limited Devices

**üì¢IMPORTANTüì¢ BAD is now available in OpenCV as [cv::xfeatures2d::TEBLID](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dd/dc1/classcv_1_1xfeatures2d_1_1TEBLID.html)**

This repository contains the source code of **BAD** (renamed as [TEBLID](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dd/dc1/classcv_1_1xfeatures2d_1_1TEBLID.html) after its inclusion in OpenCV contrib) and **HashSIFT** descriptors presented in "[Revisiting Binary Local Image Description for Resource Limited Devices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08380.pdf)". When accuracy and efficiency are both important, the descriptors in this repository offer the perfect trade-off for real-time applications and resource limited devices like smartphones, robots or drones.

## Dependencies
The code depends on OpenCV 4.
<details> 
<summary>To install OpenCV ... </summary> In Ubuntu 18.04 compile it from sources with the following instructions:

```shell script
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu 18.04)
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
# Download source code
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git --branch 4.5.2 --depth 1
# Create build directory
cd opencv && mkdir build && cd build
# Generate makefiles, compile and install
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
make -j
sudo make install
```

* NOTE: The code also compile with OpenCV 3, but without parallel for's. Thus, the description will be slower.
</details>

## Compile and Run
We provide the pre-trained execution code of BAD and HashSIFT descriptors. 
The code contains two demos. The first one estimates the fundamental matrix between 
two images of the Machine Hall 05 from [EuRoC MAV Dataset](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets).
The demo detects feature points using ORB detector (FAST + Harris score) and describes using BAD.
We draw the RANSAC inliers with less than 3px of epipolar error.
The code can be compiled with Cmake:

```shell script
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
./stereo_demo [hashsift]
```

We also show a second demo that registers a pair of planar images.

```shell script
./homography_demo [hashsift]
```

The result for the provided images should be several imshows and something like this in the standard output:
```
*************** Homography estimation demo ***************
Detected features: 1000
Matched features:   64
Inliers percentage:  6.4%
```
If ORB descriptor is used instead of BAD, only 2.4% of inliers are obtained.
